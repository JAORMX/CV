		\item [September 2015 - present]
            \textbf{Senior Software Developer @ Red Hat} (Finland)\\
            I'm part of the OpenStack-focused Identity/Security team in Red
            Hat. My main contributions have been enabling encryption in all
            networks in TripleO deployments through TLS or IPSEC (Depending on
            the deployment's needs); Enabling unified interfaces for
            configuring the service's endpoints; Building a service to
            auto-register OpenStack instances (virtual or baremetal) into
            FreeIPA; Besides doing more ad-hoc tasks and fixes on several
            opensource projects where needed.

		\item [April 2014 - September 2015]
            \textbf{Senior Software Developer @ Ericsson} (Finland)\\
            My main task was to contribute directly to the
            \textbf{OpenStack} project; Here I actively interacted with the
            community, reviewed commits and pushed code to the projects.
            I was also an active contributor to the \textbf{OPNFV}
            initiative; In OPNFV I formed part of the Security Group and
            started the audit-oriented project called \textbf{Inspector}
            there.\\

            {\url{http://stackalytics.com/?metric=commits&release=all&user_id=jaosorior&company=ericsson}}

            Before this I was part of an integration task force, with the
            aim of creating a sustainable development environment for
            developers to build on. The environment was based on
            \textbf{Docker} in order to ensure the uniformity of
            environments and to create quick and consistent builds.\\

            For a while I was also part of the Cloud Security team where
            I did numerous tasks, such as implement security related
            features; harden and test the security in our cloud solution,
            among other activities.

		\item [June 2012 - April 2014]
            \textbf{Software Developer @ Ericsson} (Finland)\\
            Worked in multimedia-based applications, as a developer in
            Ericsson's Media Gateway. Here, The type and nature of the
            tasks I performed were diverse: I've been taken part in the
            development of high performance multimedia systems; coded
            scripts to aid in version control systems migration (migrated
            from a legacy VCS to \textbf{Git}); took part in in a smaller
            project to develop a visualization of the development process
            within the division; amongst other things.\\

            Aside from that, every once in a while I gave guidance
            regarding open-source processes (licensing and implications).

		\item [July 2011 - December 2011]
            \textbf{Research assistant/Developer @ NIC Mexico} (Monterrey,
            N.L., M\'{e}xico)\\
            Developer lead of a Linux implementation for the \textbf{NAT64}
            mechanism (based on the RFC6146), which had the purpose of
            enabling communication between IPv6 and IPv4 hosts. It was
            implemented as a \textbf{kernel module}, written in \textbf{C},
            working with \textbf{Netfilter}. For user-space control, an
            iptables module was also developed. The implementation is
            open-source:

		\item [May 2010 - May 2011]
            \textbf{Research assistant @ ITESM} (Monterrey, N.L., M\'{e}xico)\\
            I developed an application (Gadget) for the \textbf{Google Wave}
            platform to collaboratively draw ER diagrams. The project used web
            technologies such as \textbf{HTML5} and the Wave platform's API,
            which is based in \textbf{Java}. Also, I contributed to the
            writing of the research paper, but mostly my role was technical.
