		\item [September 2015 - present]
            \textbf{Senior Software Developer @ Red Hat} (Finland)\\
            I'm part of the OpenStack-focused Identity/Security team in Red
            Hat. I've driven efforts to improve the security of the deployment
            overall, such as TLS enablement, policy enhancements, IPSec,
            FreeIPA integration; all following an upstream-first approach.

		\item [April 2014 - September 2015]
            \textbf{Senior Software Developer @ Ericsson} (Finland)\\
            I drove \textbf{OpenStack} open source security-related
            contributions. I also actively took part of the \textbf{OPNFV}
            community, where we started the \textbf{Inspector} project to
            enhance the auditability of OpenStack. \\

            Before this I was part of an integration task force, with the
            aim of creating a sustainable development environment for
            the engineers to build on.\\

            For a while I was also part of the Cloud Security team where
            I did numerous tasks, such as implement security related
            features; harden and test the security in our cloud solution,
            among other activities.

		\item [June 2012 - April 2014]
            \textbf{Software Developer @ Ericsson} (Finland)\\
            I've been taken part in the development of high performance
            multimedia systems; coded scripts to aid in version control
            systems migration (migrated from a legacy VCS to \textbf{Git});
            took part in in a project to develop a visualization of the
            development process within the division; amongst other things.\\

            Aside from that, every once in a while I gave guidance
            regarding open-source processes (licensing and implications).

		\item [July 2011 - December 2011]
            \textbf{Research assistant/Developer @ NIC Mexico} (Monterrey,

            Developer lead of a Linux implementation for the \textbf{NAT64}
            mechanism (based on the RFC6146), which had the purpose of
            enabling communication between IPv6 and IPv4 hosts. It was
            implemented as a \textbf{kernel module}, written in \textbf{C},
            working with \textbf{Netfilter}. For user-space control, an
            iptables module was also developed. The implementation is
            open-source:
